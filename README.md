# Neo Steelgear Graphics Scene

Lightweight scene framework built using the [Neo Steelgear Graphics Core](https://github.com/Gamewolf3000/Neo-Steelgear-Graphics-Core) framework. It provides wrappers for standard interfaces, allows for simplified creation of the resource components, as well as an easy way to utilize hlsl 6.6 dynamic indexing with the resource components. An example application utilizing the framework can be found [here](https://github.com/Gamewolf3000/D3D12-Modelviewer-with-DXR-shadows).
